Wista is a stylish minimalistic weather app that quickly gets you the information you want and leaves out what you don't want. With a clean design and no ads Wista is the perfect app to use to quickly check what today's weather is or to plan for the week.

I make calls to the [Openweather's API] (https://openweathermap.org) for weather data.
